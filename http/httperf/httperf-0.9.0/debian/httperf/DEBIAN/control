Description: An HTTP server performance tester
 httperf is a tool to measure web server  performance. It speaks the HTTP
 protocol both in its HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1 flavors and offers a variety of
 workload generators. While running, it keeps track of a number of performance
 metrics that are summarized in the form  of  statistics  that  are printed  at
 the end of a test run.
